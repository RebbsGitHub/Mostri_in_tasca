# Mostri_in_tasca
This project was developed in two versions:

- **Java** - desktop/console version available in `./java/`.
- **React Native** - mobile version available in `./react-native/`.

# Description
This is the client-side implementation of a multiplayer geolocation-based game inspired by Pok√©mon GO, built in both Java and React Native.
The application integrates:

- Google-based location tracking
- API-driven interactions with the game world
- A customizable player profile
- Automatic login linked to the first access 

Nowadays the project is no longer supported because the server has been dismantled for new purposes.
